# chemhax

Chemhax is a mobile app that allows you to input a molecular formula and find corresponding Isomer.
Our goal is to ultimately build out the app so that it can predict successful chemical reactions

# Tools To Know

For you to actively contribute to this app make sure you have a solid understanding of the following technologies:
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [Expo](https://expo.io)

# Setup
1. Install dependencies
2. Install Expo XDE
3. Open project via Expo XDE


# RoadMap

Currently chemhax operates as a mobile app that uses the api known as [orgox](https://github.com/rickyplouis/orgox) our goal is that we build out both that api and this app so that users can download it from the app store.

## Where We're At

Chemhax allows users to input a molecular formulas and find the corresponding isonomers. To do so it utilizes the [PubChem API](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pug_rest/PUG_REST_Tutorial.html). The PubChem API is fairly poor in how it handles data.

## What We Need

* We need to consider building our own database and migrating away from PubChem for the sake of scalability.
* Redesign the app architecture so that it is more accessible for developers
* Redesign redux stores for scalability

### How Can I Contribute?

Look at open issues and see what you can manage.
